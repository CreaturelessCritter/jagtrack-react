JagTrack React Module 2 - Personalization Document
================================================

Exercise 1: Multi-Page Navigation & Tabs
----------------------------------------
Design Choices:
- Used useState hook to track the current active page
- Navigation component receives currentPage and onPageChange props
- Active button uses 'filled' variant, inactive uses 'subtle' for clear visual distinction
- ClassesPage implements interactive tabs using useState to track active tab index
- Each class tab shows block letter and switches content panel dynamically
- AI Chat converted from vanilla JavaScript to React using useState, useRef, and useEffect hooks
- Demo mode enabled by default (FORCE_DEMO_MODE = true) for easy testing without API key

Exercise 2: Google Calendar Integration
---------------------------------------
Design Choices:
- Embedded Google Calendar iframe in both HomePage and CalendarPage
- Calendar shows Canvas assignment deadlines via iCal feed integration
- Responsive design with min-height of 600px on desktop, 400px on mobile
- Added mobile tip with link to open calendar in new tab for better mobile experience
- HomePage shows compact calendar preview in "Upcoming Assignments" section

Exercise 3: Dark/Light Mode Toggle
----------------------------------
Color Scheme Reasoning:
- Light mode: Clean white background (#ffffff) with dark text (#213547) for readability
- Dark mode: Near-black background (#1a1a1a) as requested, with light text (#e4e4e4)
- Accent color (#f0ad4e) remains consistent across both themes for brand identity
- Header gradient adjusts to darker blues in dark mode
- All Mantine components properly override with CSS variables

Technical Implementation:
- themes.css contains CSS variables for :root (light) and [data-theme="dark"]
- themeToggle.js exports three functions: initializeTheme(), toggleTheme(), getCurrentTheme()
- localStorage persistence saves user preference with key 'jagtrack-theme'
- main.jsx calls initializeTheme() before rendering app
- Smooth 0.3s transitions on background and text color changes

Exercise 4: About Me Page
-------------------------
Component Selection:
- Card: Profile card with photo section
- Badge: Grade level, interests, and skills display
- Paper: Content sections with consistent styling
- List: Academic goals and favorite classes
- Grid: Two-column responsive layout
- Group: Horizontal arrangement of badges and titles
- Stack: Vertical spacing of content sections
- Title: Section headings
- Text: Body content and descriptions
- Divider: Visual separation between sections
- Image: Profile photo with fallback

Responsive Design Approach:
- Grid columns: 12 on mobile, splits to 4/8 on tablet and desktop
- Profile card centers on mobile with max-width constraint
- Font sizes and spacing adjust for smaller screens
- Navigation buttons wrap nicely on mobile

Overall Module 2 Reflection
---------------------------
This module taught me important React concepts:
- useState for managing component state (active page, theme, messages)
- useEffect for side effects (auto-scroll, theme initialization)
- useRef for DOM element references (chat scroll container)
- Props for passing data between components
- Conditional rendering for page switching and loading states
- CSS variables for theming and maintainability
- localStorage for persisting user preferences

The most challenging part was converting the AI Chat from vanilla JavaScript to React,
understanding how to manage state and effects properly instead of direct DOM manipulation.
